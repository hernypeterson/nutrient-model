# nutrient-model
This activity is designed to introduce oceanography students to the theory and practice of numerical modeling. Special attention is paid to the translation of a physical system into mathematical and programmatic representations.

The main modeling project is found in the [nutrient-model.ipynb file](https://github.com/hernypeterson/nutrient-model/blob/main/nutrient-model.ipynb). This notebook presents an overview of the physical question of interest, a derivation of the system of differential equations in matrix form, and an implementation of a few model iterations, with plenty of opportunity to experiment along the way.

The [supplemental folder](https://github.com/hernypeterson/nutrient-model/tree/main/supplemental) contains additional notebooks which explore various aspects of the model and underlying mathematics in more detail. Students looking for a tailored introduction to modeling using differential equations are referred to the [single tank notebook](https://github.com/hernypeterson/nutrient-model/blob/main/supplemental/single-tank.ipynb).
